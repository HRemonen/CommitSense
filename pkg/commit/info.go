/*
Package commit provides functionality for creating Git commits.

The Info struct in this package represents information needed for creating a Git commit. It includes fields for specifying the commit type, scope, description, body, co-authors, and breaking change details.

Usage:
  - Create instances of the Info struct to define commit information.
  - Set the CommitType, CommitDescription, and other fields to configure the commit.
  - Optionally, add co-authors to the CoAuthors field if the commit is co-authored.
  - Use the IsBreakingChange field to indicate whether the commit introduces a breaking change.
  - For more information on how to use the Info struct and create Git commits, refer to the package-specific functions and commands.
