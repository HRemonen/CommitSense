/*
Package author provides functions for working with Git commit authors and co-authors.

This package includes functions for retrieving suggested co-authors who have made commits in the Git repository.
It uses the `git log` command to extract author names and email addresses from the commit history. The resulting list
of authors can be used when creating Git commits with co-authors.

Usage:
  - Call the GetSuggestedCoAuthors function to obtain a list of suggested co-authors based on the Git commit history.
