# CommitSense

![CommitSense Logo](commit_sense_logo.png)

CommitSense is a command-line tool that simplifies Git version control by providing an interactive and standardized way to stage files and create commit messages following the Conventional Commits specification.

## Features

- Interactive file selection for staging.
- Conventional Commits-based commit message generation.
- Improved commit message consistency.
- Streamlined Git workflow.

## ðŸŽ© Neckbeard Mode

If you've got a neckbeard or you've been using the console since before the dinosaurs were alive, we've got you covered! You can totally go old school and add files for staging using the `git add <filename>` command. Some even say it's faster than an interactive CLI.

Here's the cool part: CommitSense plays well with native Git commands under the hood. So, while you're using Git commands like a console wizard, CommitSense is right there, ensuring compatibility and helping you create those commits with style when you're ready!

But, there's one thing to note: CommitSense doesn't support chunking files when adding. So, for those complex file-staging tasks, you might want to stick to the classic `git add` method.
